## Description
A Pygame project I'm making for programming practice! A sort of 'etude' that will let me pick up more experience without boring myself to death, and with something to show for it at the end. 
Players will customize their 2D avatar with clothing items they can obtain by playing, then navigate dialogue with other characters and choose routes.
